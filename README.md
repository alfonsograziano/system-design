# Introduction

I'm very passionate about system design! 
Usually I make my designs on a whiteboard to relax or just to try to solve problems using different approaches. 

These are some useful resources: 
- [Gaurav Sen](https://www.youtube.com/c/GauravSensei)
- [Udemy course about system design](https://www.udemy.com/course/system-design-interview-prep/)
- [System design roadmap](https://towardsdev.com/learning-system-design-in-a-systematic-way-dcc7a12023d4)

There are a lot of interesting articles, [books](https://www.amazon.it/s?k=system+design) and courses on this topic. 
Please feel free to study from every resource available.

P.s. I feel that also courses not directly connected (for instance AWS Solution Architect) are a good fit ;) 

Happy studying :)
